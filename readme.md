So I'm Toadsworth Junior...
Hey there.
I'm a fan of the Super Mario franchise. (especially Princess Daisy)
I've been playing Genshin Impact since August 8th. (I main Sucrose)
I am interested in older web experiments. (Chrome experiments and stuff)
I am learning to Git on a phone. (because I dont have a computer)
I want to add my own twist to the tools I use.
I'm Filipino.
Uhh, yeah. That's it. I dunno what else to add in there
